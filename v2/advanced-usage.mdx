## IoT Sensor Integration

### Sensor Types and Capabilities




### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

Access comprehensive sensor data in real-time:

> **Note:**
**Dashboard Features**: Live sensor feeds, historical trends, anomaly alerts, predictive maintenance warnings, and automated reports.


```python
# Example: Query sensor data via API
from salsa_sdk import SalsaClient

client = SalsaClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Get real-time sensor readings
sensors = client.iot.get_sensors(location="kitchen_1")
for sensor in sensors:
    reading = sensor.get_latest_reading()
    print(f"{sensor.name}: {reading.value} {reading.unit}")

    if reading.is_anomaly():
        print(f"⚠️  Alert: {reading.anomaly_details}")

# Query historical data
history = client.iot.query_history(
    sensor_id="temp_sensor_001",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31",
    aggregation="hourly"
)
```

        }
      },
      "signature": "sha256=abc123..."
    }
    ```



## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

Optimize API queries for large-scale operations:

```graphql
# Use field-level caching
query GetLocations @cache(ttl: 300) {
  locations {
    id
    name
    # Only request fields you need
    currentInventory {
      ingredientId
      quantity
    }
  }
}

# Use pagination for large datasets
query GetProductionHistory(
  $first: Int = 50,
  $after: String
) {
  productionBatches(first: $first, after: $after) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        recipeId
        quantity
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategies

Implement caching for optimal performance:


1. **CDN Caching**
   Static resources cached at edge locations for fast global access.

2. **API Response Caching**
   Frequently accessed data cached with configurable TTL.

3. **Client-Side Caching**
   Use our SDK's built-in caching for repeated queries.

4. **Cache Invalidation**
   Automatic cache invalidation on data updates.
