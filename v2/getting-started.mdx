### Quality Prediction

Configure AI quality monitoring to detect issues before they occur:

```javascript
// Example: Configure quality monitoring via API
const qualityConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  monitoring_interval: "5m",  // Check every 5 minutes
  thresholds: {
    temperature: { min: 35, max: 40, unit: "F" },
    freshness_score: { min: 8.0, max: 10.0 },
    consistency: { min: 7.5 }
  },
  alert_channels: ["email", "sms", "push", "slack"],
  auto_action: {
    low_quality_detected: "pause_production",
    temperature_violation: "notify_manager"
  }
};
```
