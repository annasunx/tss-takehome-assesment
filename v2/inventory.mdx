# Inventory Management - v2.0

Track salsa ingredients with AI-powered predictions and real-time IoT sensor monitoring.

## Overview

Our v2.0 inventory management system uses artificial intelligence and IoT sensors to provide intelligent tracking, predictive ordering, and automated waste prevention.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Tracking

Monitor your ingredient levels with intelligent predictions:

- **Predictive stock levels**: AI forecasts when you'll run out
- **Automated reordering**: Smart ordering based on usage patterns
- **Usage predictions**: Machine learning predicts ingredient needs
- **Anomaly detection**: AI identifies unusual consumption patterns

```javascript
// Example: Get AI inventory predictions
const predictions = await salsa.ai.inventory.predict({
  location: "kitchen_1",
  horizon_days: 7
});

console.log(`Predicted reorder date: ${predictions.reorder_date}`);
```

### IoT Sensor Integration

Real-time monitoring with connected sensors:

- **RFID tracking**: Automatic ingredient scanning
- **Temperature sensors**: Monitor refrigeration conditions
- **Weight sensors**: Real-time stock level tracking
- **Freshness sensors**: Chemical sensors detect spoilage

### Smart Waste Prevention

AI-driven waste reduction:

- Predicts optimal order quantities
- Suggests recipes to use near-expiry ingredients
- Identifies waste patterns and root causes
- Reduces waste by up to 60% compared to v1.0

## Stock Management

### AI-Powered Low Stock Alerts

Intelligent alerts that learn from your patterns:

- Predictive alerts before you run out
- Seasonal adjustment recommendations
- Event-based usage predictions
- Supplier lead time optimization

> **Note:**
**New in v2.0**: AI learns your usage patterns and automatically adjusts alert thresholds based on historical data and upcoming events.


### Automated Supplier Integration

Seamless ordering with AI optimization:

- Automatic purchase order generation
- Price comparison across suppliers
- Quality-based supplier recommendations
- Delivery schedule optimization

## IoT Dashboard

Real-time sensor monitoring:

- Live temperature readings
- RFID location tracking
- Weight-based inventory levels
- Freshness indicators

## AI Insights

### Usage Pattern Analysis

AI identifies trends and patterns:

- Peak usage times by day/season
- Recipe popularity trends
- Waste hotspots
- Cost optimization opportunities

### Predictive Ordering

Let AI handle your ordering:

```javascript
// Example: Enable AI auto-ordering
const autoOrder = await salsa.ai.inventory.enableAutoOrder({
  location: "kitchen_1",
  max_order_value: 5000,
  approval_required_over: 1000,
  preferred_suppliers: ["sysco", "us_foods"]
});
```
