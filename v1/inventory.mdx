# Inventory Management

Track salsa ingredients, monitor freshness, and prevent waste with our intelligent inventory system.

## Overview

Our inventory management system provides real-time tracking of all your salsa ingredients, helping you maintain optimal stock levels and reduce waste.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Tracking

Monitor your ingredient levels in real-time across all locations. Get instant updates when items are used in production or received from suppliers.

```javascript
// Example: Check current inventory
const inventory = await salsa.inventory.getAll({
  location: "kitchen_1",
  status: "in_stock"
});

console.log(`Total items: ${inventory.length}`);
```

### Freshness Monitoring

Track expiration dates and receive alerts when ingredients are approaching their use-by date.

- Automatic expiration tracking
- Smart alerts 3, 7, and 14 days before expiration
- FIFO (First In, First Out) recommendations
- Batch tracking for complete traceability

### Waste Prevention

Our intelligent system helps reduce waste by:

- Predicting usage patterns
- Suggesting optimal order quantities
- Alerting when items are at risk of expiring
- Recommending recipes that use near-expiry ingredients

## Stock Management

### Low Stock Alerts

Set custom thresholds for each ingredient and receive notifications when stock runs low.

> **Note:**
**Pro Tip**: Set different alert levels for weekdays vs. weekends based on your typical usage patterns.
