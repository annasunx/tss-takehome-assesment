# Quality Control

Ensure consistent salsa quality with automated testing and quality assurance workflows.

## Overview

Maintain the highest quality standards for your salsa with our comprehensive quality control system. Track quality metrics, perform automated tests, and ensure consistency across all batches.

## Quality Scoring

### Automated Quality Tests

Perform standardized quality tests for every batch:

- **Visual inspection**: Color, consistency, texture
- **Taste profile**: Spice level, flavor balance, freshness
- **Temperature checks**: Proper storage temperatures
- **pH levels**: Safety and preservation metrics

### Scoring System

Each batch receives a comprehensive quality score (0-10 scale):

```javascript
// Example: Record quality score
const qualityCheck = await salsa.quality.recordScore({
  batch_id: "BATCH-2024-001",
  scores: {
    visual: 9.2,
    taste: 9.5,
    temperature: 10.0,
    ph_level: 8.8
  },
  notes: "Excellent batch, perfect consistency"
});
```

## Quality Standards

### Setting Standards

Define quality standards for each recipe:

- Minimum acceptable scores
- Required testing procedures
- Frequency of quality checks
- Corrective actions for failures

### Compliance Tracking

Ensure food safety compliance:

- HACCP guidelines adherence
- FDA regulations tracking
- Temperature log maintenance
- Sanitation records

## Quality Alerts

Receive immediate notifications when quality issues are detected:

- Below-threshold scores
- Temperature violations
- pH level concerns
- Visual defects

> **Warning:**
**Critical Alerts**: Quality issues that pose safety risks trigger immediate notifications to managers and halt production if necessary.


## Quality Reports

### Batch Reports

Track quality metrics for individual batches:

- Complete quality scores
- Test results history
- Trend analysis
- Comparison with previous batches

### Performance Analytics

Monitor quality performance over time:

- Average quality scores by recipe
- Quality trends and patterns
- Staff performance metrics
- Seasonal variations
